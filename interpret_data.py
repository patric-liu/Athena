'''Interpret_data takes high resolution environmental predictions and filters it
into lower resolution data to input to the neural network. When running
simulations,it will also add noise to inputs, increasing magnitude of noise with
distance in time, to simulate the uncertainty and inaccuracy of future 
predictions
