''' Uses Evolutionary Models to improve network

Creates multiple versions ('clones') of original network with slight 
pertubations ('mutations') to the parameters, runs them through a race 
simulation, and creates a new network ('child') using a weighted 
average of each clone based on its performance ('fitness')

Child then becomes the original network and this is looped over 'generations'
