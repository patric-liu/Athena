## what does a person consider when strategising?
what a person considers depends on the underlying behavior of the car and environment.

### underlying behaviors
efficiency is a function of velocity, temperature and weather conditions

There are primarily two sources of power loss due to motion
 - rolling resistance power loss is proportional to velocity, vehicle mass and tire properties
 - aerodynamic power loss is proportional to the cube of the vehicle speed relative to the air, therefore wind is an important factor. Further losses may be experienced as a result of stall if the ratio between side winds and car velocity is high. 
 other movement losses: (undesireable and more avoidable ones)
    - vibration, friction etc. due to untuned/aligned suspension
    - rubbing brakes (ISU can get 20km more a day from no rubbing)
    - flimsy shell affecting coefficient of drag

Electrical Energy loss occurs in the batteries and solar cell as a result of heating/high current
 - batteries 
 - solar cells loose 0.3% efficiency for each degree C above 25
 - Wiring

Miscelaneous Losses
 - Array shading
 - Ancillary and Telemetry
